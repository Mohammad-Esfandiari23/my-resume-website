        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <h3>The Beginning: A Passion for the Brain</h3>
        <p>
            Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by the complexity of the brain—how it functions, how it shapes our perception, and how it enables us to interact with the world.
            As a teenager, I knew I wanted to study <strong>psychology</strong> to explore these mysteries. However, in Iran, pursuing psychology at the university level required choosing the <strong>humanities track</strong> in high school—
            a path that heavily focused on abstract concepts rather than the tangible, hands-on problem-solving that I enjoyed.
        </p>

        <p>
            This choice surprised those around me because, despite my passion for psychology, I had always excelled in <strong>building, experimenting, and applied sciences</strong>.
            During my high school years, I won <strong>third place nationwide</strong> in the <strong>Kharazmi Festival</strong>, a prestigious scientific competition, for designing a unique <strong>electrical device with innovative features</strong>.
            My ability to combine technical knowledge with problem-solving became clear at an early stage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Determined to pursue psychology despite these expectations, I prepared for Iran’s highly competitive <strong>National University Entrance Exam (Konkur)</strong>.
            Out of <strong>282,151 applicants</strong>, I ranked in the <strong>top 0.2093%</strong>, securing a place at <strong>Shahid Beheshti University</strong>, one of Iran’s <strong>top three psychology programs</strong>.
            I majored in <strong>Counseling Psychology</strong>, a field focused on the <strong>practical applications of psychological theories</strong>, particularly in therapy and mental health interventions.
        </p>

        <h3>A Turning Point: The Need for Experimental Science</h3>

                <p>
                    By the end of my third year of undergraduate studies, I felt increasingly dissatisfied. While I appreciated the theoretical foundations of psychology, I craved something more
                    <strong>tangible, empirical, and measurable</strong>. I wanted to go beyond reading established theories and start testing hypotheses, running experiments, and working with real data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This realization led me toward <strong>data analysis and statistics</strong>. I became proficient in <strong>SPSS</strong> and began collaborating with students on research projects by handling their <strong>statistical analyses</strong>.
                    One of these projects examined how <strong>maladaptive perfectionism contributes to heightened social anxiety, ultimately hindering athletic performance</strong>.
                    This experience helped me develop my skills in <strong>statistical modeling and hypothesis testing</strong>, reinforcing my desire to transition into a more experimental, quantitative approach to psychology.

        <h3>Discovering Neuroscience</h3>
        <p>
            My growing interest in <strong>data-driven research</strong> naturally led me to the field of <strong>neuroscience</strong>.
            I became captivated by the idea of understanding cognition through <strong>neural mechanisms, computational approaches, and behavioral data analysis</strong>.
            Since Iran does not offer a dedicated neuroscience master’s program, I chose to pursue my <strong>Master’s in General Psychology</strong>—
            a field that, in Iran, heavily emphasizes experimental psychology and shares significant overlap with cognitive neuroscience.
        </p>

        <p>
            To secure admission into this program, I took the highly competitive <strong>Iranian National Graduate Entrance Exam</strong>, ranking in the <strong>top 0.09% of 80,000 applicants</strong>.
            This achievement allowed me to join <strong>Allameh Tabataba’i University</strong>, one of Iran’s <strong>top three psychology departments</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my graduate studies, I focused on refining my <strong>programming skills</strong>, incorporating <strong>Python and MATLAB</strong> into my research.
            This skill set allowed me to work on more advanced experimental paradigms, leading me to my current focus: <strong>reaction time modeling and temporal prediction</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My current research investigates how <strong>reaction times vary across sensory modalities</strong> (e.g., vision and motor responses) and how the brain encodes time to <strong>predict future events</strong>.
            I am currently working on a <strong>research paper</strong> in this domain, which is expected to be <strong>published within the next six months</strong>.
